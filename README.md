# Overview

Space Colors is a fast-paced, visually dynamic web game designed entirely with HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and SASS—without using any images! Every visual element in the game, from backgrounds to animations, is generated purely through code, making it a unique example of creative front-end development. With smooth animations, complex visual elements, and a self-built collider system, Space Colors delivers an engaging arcade-like experience right in your browser.
